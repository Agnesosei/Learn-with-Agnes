Today, we will dive deeper into variables, data types, and operators in C programming. We'll explore the concept of variables and constants, including their declaration, initialization, and naming conventions. We'll discuss the basic data types available in C and their characteristics, helping you understand which data type to choose for different situations.

Next, we'll introduce arithmetic operators and demonstrate how to perform mathematical operations in C. We'll also cover relational and logical operators, enabling you to evaluate conditions and make decisions based on comparisons. Additionally, we'll delve into type conversions and casting, providing insights on how to handle data type conversions effectively.

Throughout this lesson, you'll find exercises and examples that allow you to practice using variables, perform calculations, and make logical decisions. By the time we are done, you should have a solid understanding of variables, data types, and operators in C, setting the stage for more complex programming concepts in the subsequent chapters.

## Variables and Contants

## Basic Data Types

In C programming, variables (and constants) are used to store and manipulate data. Before using a variable (or a constant), you need to declare it by specifying its data type. C provides several built-in data types, including:

**a. Integers**: Used to represent whole numbers. Examples include int, short, long, and char.Â 

**b. Floating-Point Numbers:** Used to represent decimal numbers with fractional parts. Examples include float and double.

**c. Characters:** Used to represent individual characters. The char data type is commonly used for this purpose.

**d. Arrays**: Used to store a collection of elements of the same data type.

**e. Pointers:** Used to store memory addresses and manipulate memory directly.

## Declaring and Initializing a Variable

To declare a variable in C, you need to specify its data type and name. Here's the general syntax for declaring a variable:

`data_type variable_name;`

For example, to declare an integer variable named "num":

`int num;`

You can also initialize a variable at the time of declaration by assigning it a value:

`int age = 25;`

### Type Conversion and Casting

Typecasting allows you to convert a value from one data type to another. This can be useful when you need to perform operations or assignments between variables of different data types.

To perform typecasting, you can use the syntax:

`new_data_type variable_name = (new_data_type) value;`

For example, to cast an integer variable "num" to a float:

```c
int num = 10;
float floatNum = (float) num;
```

## Operators

Operators are symbols used to perform operations on variables and values. C provides various types of operators, including:

**a. Arithmetic Operators**: Used for mathematical calculations, such as addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (\*), division (/), and modulus (%).

**b. Relational Operators:** Used to compare values, such as equality (==), inequality (!=), greater than (&gt;), less than (&lt;), greater than or equal to (&gt;=), and less than or equal to (&lt;=).

**c. Logical Operators:** Used to perform logical operations, such as logical AND (&&), logical OR (||), and logical NOT (!).

**d. Assignment Operators:** Used to assign values to variables, such as the equal sign (=), compound assignment operators (+=, -=, \*=, /=), and more.

**e. Increment and Decrement Operators:** Used to increase (++), or decrease (--), the value of a variable by 1.
