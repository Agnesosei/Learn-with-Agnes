Now that we have written our first program, I am sure like Oliver Twist, you want more. Well, fear not, for today we unlock the magic of user interaction!

**The standard input /output header** (&lt;stdio.h&gt;) contains some functions we can call depending on whether we want to feed input into our program or display or print something on the screen. 

In our earlier lesson, we ran our first program and called the printf() function. Without telling the linker to include (link) the library that contains the standard input (stdin) and the standard output (stdout) header, we would not have been able to use printf(). 

Let's try that and see what happens. 

```c
int main (void) 
{
    printf("Hey Agnes! Let's learn together") ;
    return 0;
}
```

What happens when you run this code? 

By including the `<stdio.h>` header in our code, we open the gates to accepting input from the user via the keyboard and displaying captivating output on the screen. Get ready to embark on an exciting journey as we explore the functions that bring our programs to life!

As we stated earlier, we can call a function from &lt;stdio.h&gt; depending on whether we want to accept user input or print a message. 

To accept input, we can use:

`getc(stdin)` 

`getchar()` 

`scanf()` 

To display output, we can use:

`puts()` 

`printf()` 

The 'f' in printf() and scanf() represent **'formatted'**.  
While printf() and scan(f) are **formatted** input and output, getc(), getchar(), puts() are **unformatted** inputs and output respectively. 

### **Printf() and Puts() functions**.

As we said earlier, `printf(`) and `puts()` are output functions. Whereas `printf()` is formatted, `puts()` is unformatted,

Get ready to showcase your imagination by displaying stunning output on the screen using these enchanting functions:

**The Enchanter:** `printf()`

Cast a spell with `printf()`! This powerful function lets you conjure formatted output. Mix in some placeholders and format specifiers to create captivating messages with data that will leave your users spellbound!

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
    printf("Hey Agnes! Let's learn together\n");
    return 0;
}
```

**The Showman:** `puts()`

Step right up and witness the magic of `puts()`! This function dazzles your audience with unformatted strings. It adds a touch of elegance by automatically including a newline character, leaving your users in awe!

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
    puts("Hey Agnes! Let's learn together");
    return 0;
}
```

### **Engaging with User Input**

Prepare to engage in interactive adventures by accepting input from your users using these captivating functions:

**The Mind Reader:** `scanf()`

Enter the world of mind reading with `scanf()`! This function allows you to decipher input based on specified format specifiers. Prepare to unravel the mysteries hidden within the user's input!

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
    char let;
    printf("What's the first letter of your name?\n");
    scanf("%c", &let);
    printf("You entered: %c\n", let);
    return 0;
}
```

**The Character Whisperer**: `getc(stdin)` and `getchar()`

Become a character whisperer with `getc(stdin)` and `getchar()`! These functions let you extract single characters from the user's input via the standard input (`stdin`). Immerse yourself in the enchantment of unformatted input!

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
    char let;
    printf("What's the first letter of your name?\n");
    let = getc(stdin);
    printf("You entered: %c\n", let);
    return 0;
}
```

Note: In these code examples, we guide users to provide input and display their entered values.

Congratulations on harnessing the power of standard input and output functions in C programming! By mastering the art of `printf()`, `puts()`, `scanf()`, `getc(stdin)`, and `getchar()`, you can create programs that truly engage and captivate your audience. So go forth, weave your code spells, and create interactive experiences that leave users eagerly awaiting their next encounter with your enchanting programs!
